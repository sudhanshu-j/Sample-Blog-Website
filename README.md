## üìù Project Overview

This project combines a **Sample Blog Website** with a **Login & Sign-Up Page**. Both sections provide a smooth user experience, responsive design, and modern UI, and are designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. 

The blog section includes a dynamic filterable grid of posts, where users can filter content by category. The login page provides a seamless transition between **Sign In** and **Sign Up** forms with social media sign-in options.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### **Sample Blog Website:**

- **Home Page**: On visiting the blog page, you will see a grid layout of blog posts.

- **Filter Posts**: You can filter posts by categories such as ‚ÄúAll‚Äù, ‚ÄúWeb Development‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù, etc. When you click a category, only the relevant posts will appear.

- **Sticky Navbar**: As you scroll down, the navigation bar will stick to the top of the screen, with a shadow effect to indicate that it is now fixed at the top.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Resize your browser window to test the responsive behavior. The layout adjusts according to different screen sizes.

### **Login & Sign-Up Page:**

- **Sign In Form**: The default form displayed when the page loads is the Sign In form.

- **Sign Up Form**: Clicking the Sign Up button smoothly animates the form transition to show the Sign Up form.

- **Switch Between Forms**: You can toggle between Sign In and Sign Up using their respective buttons.

- **Social Media Login**: The login page includes icons for Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Instagram for social login.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts perfectly for mobile screens. The forms stack vertically and the background becomes a smooth gradient.

## üîë How It Works

### **Sample Blog Website:**

- **HTML Structure**:  
   The page structure is divided into sections like the header (with navigation), the main content (with blog posts), and the footer. Each blog post is contained within a `<div>` that holds the title, content, and a category for filtering.

- **CSS Styling**:  
   The blog layout is built using Flexbox and Grid systems to ensure it‚Äôs responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The navbar becomes sticky with CSS on scroll, and the filtering of posts uses smooth transitions.

- **JavaScript/jQuery**:  
   The filtering functionality is implemented using jQuery. When a filter button is clicked, jQuery is used to hide and show the relevant posts, along with a smooth transition effect. The sticky navbar effect is controlled using JavaScript to toggle the shadow class when the page is scrolled.

### **Login & Sign-Up Page:**

- **HTML Structure**:  
   The page is divided into two main forms, Sign In and Sign Up. Each form contains the necessary fields: username, password, and email for the sign-up form.

- **CSS Styling**:  
   The forms are styled with rounded inputs and a modern gradient background. Hover effects are added to buttons and social media icons. The page background uses a circular gradient effect that transitions when switching between the sign-up and sign-in forms.

- **JavaScript**:  
   The transition between the Sign In and Sign Up forms is achieved by toggling the `sign-up-mode` class on the container element, which animates the transition of the forms. The social media login buttons are designed with hover effects, and clicking them simulates a social login action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the page, including the forms, posts, and layout elements.

- **CSS3**: Applied for all styling, including layout, color schemes, gradients, animations, and transitions.

- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the dynamic functionality such as form transitions and blog post filtering.

- **jQuery**: Utilized to filter blog posts and add smooth animations.

- **Font Awesome**: For social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram) used in the login page.

- **Google Fonts**: Used the "Playfair Display" font to provide an elegant and readable typography.
